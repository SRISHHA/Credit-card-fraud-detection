The overarching goal of this project was to develop an efficient and accurate credit card fraud detection system capable of identifying suspicious transactions.


The project flow goes like this


1.Understanding the problem and data

2.Data cleaning

3.Exploratory Data Analysis

4.Preprocessing the data 

5.Machine Learning Model Building

6.Cross Validation 

7.Feature importance of best model

This project mainly focuses on removing the imbalance in the dataset by applying SMOTE technique.
Followed by building models checking out the best classification model by cross validation scores and comparing them.
